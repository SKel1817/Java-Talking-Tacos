# CSI2300_Final_project

### Introduction: 
Our project is an ordering system and an employee clocking system for a Taco Truck. An
employee or manager is able to enter a username and password. After entering these things the
person is able to select their name and choose to clock in or clock out. Also, the user can click
the “orders” button and choose the amount of chicken tacos, beef tacos, and pepsi they want to
order. The user is then able to click 0 in order to exit the ordering system and the user then is
shown an output screen which displays their final total alongside multiple tax options.
